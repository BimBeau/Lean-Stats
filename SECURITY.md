# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Lean Stats provides security updates **only for the latest stable release**.

Users are strongly encouraged to keep the plugin up to date and to run it on a supported environment (WordPress and PHP versions required by the plugin).

Older releases and unsupported environments do **not** receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Lean Stats, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### How to report

- **Preferred method**:  
  Use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting feature available in this repository  
  (Security → Report a vulnerability).

- **Alternative**:  
  If GitHub reporting is not available, contact the maintainers by email at:  
  **security@bimbeau.fr**

Please include as much detail as possible:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The impact and potential exploit scenarios
- The environment in which the issue occurs (WordPress / PHP versions)

### What to expect

- An acknowledgment of your report within a reasonable timeframe
- An assessment of the vulnerability’s impact
- A coordinated fix and release, if the issue is confirmed
- A security advisory published once the fix is available

Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix has been released, to help protect users of the plugin.

## Scope

Lean Stats is designed with a privacy-first approach and avoids collecting personal or persistent identifiers.  
However, any issue that could impact data integrity, availability, or site security should be reported.

Thank you for helping keep Lean Stats secure.
