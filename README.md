# Lean Stats

A **privacy-friendly, self-hosted WordPress analytics plugin**.  
Lightweight, cookie-free statistics designed for administrators: no banners, no third-party scripts, native Gutenberg UI, and reliable data without consent friction.

## 🎯 Goals

Lean Stats is built to provide **useful site insights** while staying **minimal, fast, and privacy-friendly**:

- No cookies (no `document.cookie`, no localStorage/sessionStorage)
- No persistent identifiers (no user IDs, no fingerprinting)
- No third-party scripts (everything runs self-hosted)
- Admin-first UX with a native Gutenberg-style UI
- Aggregate-first data model (focus on trends, not people)

## 📊 What Lean Stats tracks (Free)

Lean Stats focuses on **aggregated metrics**, not user journeys.

### Core metrics
- Hits / pageviews (aggregated)
- Time series (per day, optionally per hour)
- Top pages (by pageviews)
- Referrers by domain (e.g. `google.com`, `instagram.com`)
- Device class (mobile / desktop / tablet)

### Optional modules (privacy-safe)
- 404 tracking (top missing URLs + counts)
- Internal WordPress search terms (counts only, no user info)
- UTM “safe mode” (basic) *(optional / can be enabled later)*
  - allowlist only (e.g. `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`)
  - normalization to prevent storing arbitrary PII in URLs

## 🚫 What Lean Stats deliberately does NOT do

To keep Lean Stats lean and avoid consent-driven tracking patterns, the plugin does **not** provide:

- “Visitors” or “sessions” as exact metrics  
  *(no cookies → no true session tracking)*
- Unique visitors (exact), returning visitors, cohorts
- Individual user journeys or clickstreams
- Fingerprinting or probabilistic identification
- Heatmaps, session replay, or behavioral profiling
- Ad / retargeting integrations
- Any tracking that requires third-party scripts

## 🔐 Privacy by design

Lean Stats is designed to minimize data collection:

- No IP stored in clear (ideally no IP stored at all)
- Referrer stored as domain only (no full referrer URLs)
- URL cleaning by default (strip query strings unless allowlisted)
- Data retention: aggregated data kept for reporting; optional short-lived raw logs (if enabled) are limited and purged automatically
- Soft rate limiting uses ephemeral, hashed IPs held in memory cache only; raw IPs are never persisted
- Short deduplication window prevents repeated identical hits within seconds
- Optional support for GPC / DNT signals (configurable)

> Note: Legal requirements vary by jurisdiction and by how a site is configured. Lean Stats is engineered to minimize risk by avoiding common consent-triggering tracking patterns.

## 🧩 Admin UI

Lean Stats integrates directly inside WordPress Admin:

- Gutenberg-style UI using `@wordpress/components`
- Fast dashboard: KPIs, time series charts, and top lists
- Minimal interactions: tooltips, skeleton loading, and clear empty states
- Settings screen for strict mode, DNT / GPC compliance, URL allowlists, retention, and role exclusions

## 🌍 Localization

Lean Stats uses the `lean-stats` text domain for PHP and JavaScript strings, and the admin UI follows the effective WordPress locale (user profile locale overrides the site locale). The `languages/` directory stores translation sources for French, English, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, and Turkish.

## 🛠 Requirements

- WordPress **6.4+**
- PHP **8.0+**

## 📦 Build plugin zip

Use the script to generate a distributable plugin archive in `dist/`.
The build process generates `.mo` files and JavaScript translation JSON files in `languages/` when WP-CLI is available.

```bash
npm run build:zip
```

## ✅ Localization testing

- Site locale `fr_FR`, user locale `en_US`: the Lean Stats admin UI displays English strings.
- Site locale `en_US`, user locale `fr_FR`: the Lean Stats admin UI displays French strings.
- Site locale `fr_FR`, user locale not overridden: the Lean Stats admin UI displays French strings.

## 🗺 Roadmap

- UI improvements & reporting enhancements
- Expanded Content view (pages, 404, internal search)
- Acquisition view (referrers, safe campaign tracking)
- Improved export options
